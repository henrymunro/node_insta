# node_insta

I bulit this bot as I wanted to mess around with web scraping. The bot logs into an Instagram account and likes a number of photos from a user defined list of hashtags. The purpose of this investigate whether this would drum up reciprical interest in my Instagram page, which it did. 

It is a NodeJS server and the scraping application runs on a daily schedule.
